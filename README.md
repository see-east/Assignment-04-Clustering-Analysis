ISYS 312U: Predictive Analytics

This project focuses on Advertising for the Automotive Industry, specifically analyzing factors that influence vehicle sales, pricing, and advertising effectiveness. The goal is to identify which features have the greatest impact on predictive models for sales and customer engagement.

Dataset Description and Source
Data from the Global EV Sales: 2010-2024 data set on Kaggle Link to data set on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patricklford/global-ev-sales-2010-2024 The dataset includes vehicle-level information such as:

value – vehicle price
year – model year
region – geographic market (e.g., Europe, China, India, Rest of the World)
category – historical vs projected sales data
mode – vehicle type (Cars, Vans, Buses)
The data was sourced from 'IEA Global EV Data 2024.csv' downloaded by the author which captured both historical sales performance and projections across multiple global regions.

My Findings
While traditional labeled models capture some key factors, such as vehicle value and year, they fall short of fully representing the nuances of automotive advertising and EV adoption. Even when overall accuracy seems high, reliance on labels alone overlooks patterns that can be revealed by clustering, as unsupervised segmentation can uncover hidden patterns beyond pre-defined labels. Clustering can help improve targeting and segmentation in ways traditional labeling cannot, ultimately reducing waste and enhancing strategic decision-making across marketing and operational planning.
